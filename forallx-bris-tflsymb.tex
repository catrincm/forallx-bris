\chapter{First steps towards Symbolization}
In Part \ref{ch.TFL} we have introduced syntax and semantics of the language of Truth Functional Logic. Now we wish to put the formal apparatus to use. We wish to show how we can symbolize arguments of English (or some other language) and then test them for validity.

Recall the arguments we discussed at the beginning of Part \ref{ch.TFL}, e.g., the argument
\begin{earg}
		\prem It is raining outside.
		\prem If it is raining outside, then Jenny is miserable.
		\conc Jenny is miserable.
	\end{earg}

We determined that the argument was of the form:
\begin{earg}
\prem	$A$
\prem	If $A$ then $B$
\conc $B$
\end{earg}

 We might symbolize the argument in TFL as follows:
 $$A,A\eif B\therefore B.$$
And, on the face of it, this seems to be a pretty good symbolization.  We us the sentence letters `$A$' and `$B$' to stand for the declarative sentences `it is raining outside' and `Jenny is miserable' respectively, and the `if\ldots, then \ldots' in terms of the conditional connective. Recall that we introduced the conditional with the `if\ldots, then\ldots' reading in mind and that we motivated the truth table for the conditional using this understanding. Of course, now that we have a symbolization of the argument it is straightforward to test whether the argument is valid or not: we simply build a truth table.

Now, let's look at the argument
\begin{earg}
		\prem It is raining outside.
		\prem  It is not raining outside or Jenny is miserable.
		\conc Jenny is miserable.
	\end{earg}
The form of the argument seems to be the following:
\begin{earg}
		\prem A
		\prem  not A or B
		\conc B
	\end{earg}
If we use the sentence letters `$A$' and `$B$' to stand for same declarative sentences as in the previous argument, the argument can be aptly symbolized in TFL by:
$$A,\enot A\eor B\therefore B.$$
Recall that we introduced the negation connective in terms of `not' or `it is not the case', and understood the disjunction connective in terms of the English conjunction word `or'. Given these assumptions the symbolization of the English argument turns out to be a valid TFL argument.

Our informal procedure for symbolizing English arguments can be summarized as follows: identify the form of the argument; identify the English (sub)sentence appearing in the argument with sentence letters, that is, atomic sentences of TFL and symbolize the conjunction words by the matching connective. But what precisely is the matching connective? The answer to this question might have been straightforward in the arguments above, but that's not always the case. It is worth tackling the idea of symbolization more systematically. %\textcolor{red}{First, however, we need to address the problem of ambiguity in English.}

\chapter{Symbolizing Arguments}
\section{Atomic sentences}
The starting point of symbolizing arguments in TFL was to identify (sub)sentences that were the \emph{building blocks} of the argument and to symbolize them in TFL using certain sentence letters, e.g. in the previous chapter we used:
\begin{itemize}
\item[A:]It's raining outside.
\item[B:]Jenny is miserable.
\end{itemize}
Such an assignment of declarative sentences to atomic sentences is called a \define{symbolization key}. Specifying a symbolization key is the first step in formalizing an argument in TFL. In doing this, we are not fixing this symbolization \emph{once and for all}. We are just saying that, for the time being, we will think of the atomic sentence of TFL, `$A$', as symbolizing the English sentence `It is raining outside', and the atomic sentence of TFL, `$B$', as symbolizing the English sentence `Jenny is miserable'. Later, when we are dealing with different sentences or different arguments, we can provide a new symbolization key; as it might be:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[A] Jenny is an anarcho-syndicalist
		\item[B] Dipan is an avid reader of Tolstoy
	\end{ekey}
It is important to understand that whatever structure an English sentence might have is lost when it is symbolized by an atomic sentence of TFL. Recall that from the point of view of TFL, an atomic sentence is just a letter. It can be used to build more complex sentences, but it cannot be taken apart.

Once we have fixed a symbolization key, the next step is to symbolize the complex sentences of the argument, that is, the sentences that conjoin different sentences into a new more complex sentence via conjunction words. This requires a closer look at the relation between specific conjunction words and the connectives of TFL.


\section{Symbolizing Complex Sentences}\label{s:SymbolisingComplexTFL}
We introduced our connectives giving their rough English meaning. This gives us some tools to know how to symbolise English sentences. As a general instruction:
\factoidbox{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a sentence can be paraphrased as `it is not the case that \ldots'\\ it can be symbolised as $\enot\metaX$.
		\item If a sentence can be paraphrased as `\ldots and \ldots'\\ it can be symbolised as $\metaX\eand \metaY$.
		\item If a sentence can be paraphrased as `\ldots or \ldots'\\ it can be symbolised as $\metaX\eor \metaY$.
		\item If a sentence can be paraphrased as `if \ldots, then \ldots'\\ it can be symbolised as $\metaX\eif \metaY$.
	\end{itemize}
}

Usually, this process needs to be applied a number of times.
Let's go through an example to see how to apply the strategy. Consider:
\begin{earg}
	\item[\ex{negcon1}] You won't get both soup and salad.
	%\item[\ex{negcon2}] You will not get soup but you will get salad.
\end{earg}
Let's start with the symbolization procedure.
\begin{center}
	\begin{forest}
		[You won't get both soup and salad.\\\mainconnective{It's not the case that} you will get both soup and salad\\$\mainconnective{\enot}\ldots$
		[You will get both soup and salad]
		]
	\end{forest}
\end{center}
Our next stage is to aim to symbolise `you will get both soup and salad'
\begin{center}
	\begin{forest}
		[You won't get both soup and salad.\\\mainconnective{It's not the case that} you will get both soup and salad\\$\mainconnective{\enot}\ldots$
		[You will get both soup and salad\\You will get soup \mainconnective{and} you will get salad\\$\ldots \mainconnective{\eand} \ldots$
		[You will get soup]
		[You will get salad]
		]
		]
	\end{forest}
\end{center}
Both `You will get soup' and `You will get salad' cannot be paraphrased in any of our standard forms so we have to use an atomic TFL-sentence. As we haven't already introduced any atomic TFL-sentences, we need to introduce new ones. Let's say 
\begin{ekey}
	\item[S_1] You will get soup
	\item[S_2] You will get salad
\end{ekey}
So we can replace these leaves of the symbolisation tree with the atomic sentences, and then work the way back up to determine the symbolisation of the original sentence. 
\begin{center}
	\begin{forest}
		[You won't get both soup and salad.\\\mainconnective{It's not the case that} you will get both soup and salad\\$\mainconnective{\enot}(S_1 {\eand} S_2)$
		[You will get both soup and salad\\You will get soup \mainconnective{and} you will get salad\\$S_1 \mainconnective{\eand} S_2$
		[You will get soup\\$S_1$]
		[You will get salad\\$S_2$]
		]
		]
	\end{forest}
\end{center}

More generally, here's our strategy:
\begin{highlighted}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{bpr} Consider whether the sentence can be paraphrased as sentences in one of our standard forms. 
			\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{l l}
				\textbf{paraphrased as} & \textbf{symbolised as}\\[.2em]
				\hline
				`It is not the case that \ldots' & $\enot\metaX$\\
				`\ldots and\ldots' & $(\metaX\eand\metaY)$\\
				`\ldots or\ldots' & $(\metaX\eand\metaY)$\\
				`If $\ldots_X$ then $\ldots_Y$' & $(\metaX\eif\metaY)$
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center} 
		If the answer is no, go to Step \ref{epr}. If the answer is yes, go to Step \ref{cpr}.
		\item\label{cpr} Symbolize the sentence in accordance with the symbolization guideline with the component sentences in the place of the metavariables. For each of the component sentences, repeat the procedure, that is, go back to Step \ref{bpr}.
		\item\label{epr} Check the symbolization key to see if we already have already chosen an atomic TFL-sentence to symbolise that English sentence. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If so, replace the English sentence by that atomic TFL-sentence.
				\item Otherwise, choose a new atomic TFL-sentence to symbolize the sentence, extend the symbolization key accordingly and replace the English sentence by the atomic TFL sentence.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{highlighted}
\todo{add symbolisation tree}

%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Per above we see that the sentence can be constructed from other sentences by means of conjunction words. We move to Step \ref{cpr}.
%\item Applying the instructions in Step \ref{cpr} we obtain:
%$$\enot\text{you will get soup and you will get salad}.$$
%\item Still per instruction of Step \ref{cpr}, we move to Step \ref{bpr} to start the symbolization procedure for the sentence  `you will get soup and you will get salad.'
%\item The sentence is clearly a conjunction so we move to Step \ref{cpr}. By following the symbolization guidelines and the constructions of Step \ref{cpr}, we obtain:
%$$\enot(\text{ you will get soup }\eand\text{ you will get salad}).$$
%\item Now per instruction of Step \ref{cpr} we need to start the symbolization procedure for both, the sentence `you will get soup' and the sentence `you will get salad' starting with the former one, and got to Step \ref{bpr}
%\item `you will get soup' cannot be paraphrased as being constructed from other sentences, so we are instructed to go to Step \ref{epr}.
%\item we choose the atomic sentence $S_1$ as the symbolization of `you will get soup', and obtain
%$$\enot(S_1\eand\text{ you will get salad}).$$
%\item Equally, the sentence `you will get salad' cannot be paraphrased as being constructed from other sentences, so we are instructed to go to Step \ref{epr}.
%\item we choose the atomic sentence $S_2$ as the symbolization of `you will get salad', and obtain
%$$\enot(S_1\eand S_2).$$
%\item The TFL-sentence `$\enot(S_1\eand S_2)$' is the symbolization of the English sentence `It's not the case that you will get both soup and salad'.
%\end{itemize}

This process may seem very tedious and, of course, very often we can determine a correct symbolization of an English sentence without sticking painstakingly to this step by step process. However, by sticking to the process we make sure not to move too quickly. So if you are unsure of how to symbolize a sentence, the process provides a safety net. Yet before starting with the symbolization process one should determine the precise sentential structure of the sentence under consideration. Consider a slight variant of Sentence \ref{negcon1}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is not the case that you will get soup and you will get salad.
\end{itemize}
In this form the sentence displays a potential ambiguity between:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is not the case that: you will get soup and you will get salad.
	\item It is not the case that you will get soup, and you will get salad.
\end{itemize}
As we have seen the first reading gets symbolized as $\enot(S_1\eand S_2)$, while the second reading should be symbolized as $(\enot S_1\eand S_2)$ (Exercise: check that this is the correct symbolization). These two symbolizations are of course very different and, thus, at the beginning of the symbolization process it is important to determine the precise structure of the sentence one wishes to symbolize. We discuss this issue some more in Chapter \ref{s:AmbiguityTFL}.

\section{Symbolizing Arguments}
We have learned how to symbolize English sentences in TFL. But how does one symbolize arguments in TFL? The answer should not be to surprising: one simply needs to symbolize the premises and conclusion in TFL with the caveat that one must use one and the same symbolization key in this symbolization process. Let's look at a simple example (notice that the argument may not be sound):

\begin{earg}
	\prem Rishi Sunak will make Great Britain great again or he will loose the election.
	\prem Rishi Sunak will not make Great Britain great again.
	\conc Rishi Sunak will loose the election.
\end{earg}

with the following symbolization key:
\begin{ekey}
	\item[R] Rishi Sunak will make Great Britain great again.
	\item[L] Rishi Sunak will loose the election.
\end{ekey}

Using our symbolization procedure we then obtain the following TFL-argument $$R\eor L,\enot R\therefore L$$ which can be checked for logical validity (Check!).



\chapter{Conjunction-words and TFL-Connectives}\label{sec:symbcon}


Consider these sentences:
\begin{earg}
	\item \mainconnective{Although} Alice will come to the party, Beth will not.  
	\item Alice will come to the party, \mainconnective{but} Beth will not.  
	\item \mainconnective{Either} Alice \mainconnective{or} Beth will come to the party \mainconnective{\emph{(and not both)}}.  
	\item \mainconnective{Unless} Alice will come to the party, Beth will not.  
	\item \mainconnective{Neither} Alice \mainconnective{nor} Beth will come to the party.  
	\item Alice will come to the party \mainconnective{only if} Beth will too.
	\item Alice will come to the party \mainconnective{if} Beth will too.
	\item Alice will come to the party \mainconnective{if and only if} Beth will. 
\end{earg}

In this chapter we will discuss how they should be symbolised in TFL.  The feature of TFL is that it can capture any \emph{truth functional} connective (recall \ref{s:TruthFunctionality}), possibly by a more complex sentence. 

We will also discuss in more detail when it is appropriate to paraphrase in the cannonical ways and when it is not.


%Certain conjunction words and expressions motivated the semantics, that is, the truth tables for the connectives of TFL. But there are further expressions in English that allow us to conjoin sentences together: some can be symbolized by one of the connectives of TFL we discussed, while others might need to be symbolized by appealing to a complex TFL-sentence (recall our discussion of the \emph{exclusive or} in \S\ref{sec:tt}). 
%As we shall see, there are still others that cannot be symbolized in TFL. 

%Let's first have a look which conjunction words and expressions can be directly symbolized by one of the TFL-connectives.

\section{Negation}
Let's start by recalling the guideline we proposed in Section \ref{sec:tt}.
\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased as `it is not the case that \ldots'\\ it can be symbolised as $\enot\metaX$.
}
How are we to understand this guideline? Consider the following sentences:
 \begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{not4}] The information is retrievable.
		\item[\ex{not4b}] The information is not be retrievable.
		\item[\ex{not5}] The information is irretrievable.
		\item[\ex{not5b}] The information is not irretrievable.
	\end{earg}
Let us use the following representation key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[R] The information is retrievable.
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{not4} can now be symbolized by $R$. Moving on to sentence \ref{not5}: saying that the information is irretrievable means that it is not the case that the information is retrievable. So even though sentence \ref{not5} does not contain the word `not', we will symbolize it as `$\enot R$'.

Sentence \ref{not5b} can be paraphrased as `It is not the case that the information is irretrievable.' Which can again be paraphrased as `It is not the case that it is not the case that the information is retrievable'. So we might symbolize this English sentence with the TFL sentence `$\enot\enot R$'. In other words, in English we can also express negation using prefixes such as `\emph{ir}' or `\emph{un}'. There are still further ways of expressing negation, for example, sometimes this may be done using  the prefix `\emph{dis}' as in honest/dishonest.

But some care is needed when handling negations. For example, one might think that sentences \ref{not6} and \ref{not7} negate each other and that if we symbolize sentence \ref{not6} with $G$, then we should symbolize sentence  \ref{not7} as $\enot G$.

\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{not6}] Stealing is good.
		\item[\ex{not7}] Stealing is bad.
		\end{earg}

There are two reasons why that would not be a good symbolization. For one, while we may all agree that stealing is not a good thing to do, we may think that it is perhaps not exactly bad, if someone who is on the verge of starvation steels some food. In other words, there may be things that are neither good nor bad. However,  in TFL if `$G$' is false, then `$\enot G$' is true and we would not have the option so say that something, e.g.~stealing, is neither good nor bad. If we symbolize sentence \ref{not7} using a new sentence letter, say `$B$', then we can allow for that option. For another, there is no syntactic marker such as a prefix, a word like `not', etc.~that suggests that the sentences \ref{not6} and \ref{not7} are negations of each other. There is nothing in the structure of the two sentences that suggests that one negates the other.  But recall that one principal goal for symbolization is to check whether a given argument is valid and consider the argument:
\begin{earg}
\prem Steeling is good or donating for charity is good.
\prem Steeling is bad.
\conc Donating for charity is good.
\end{earg}
While this is a good argument and perhaps a conceptually valid argument it is not valid in the strict sense because it not valid in virtue of its form: it requires understanding `bad' as `not good'. So, if we were to symbolize \ref{not7} as `$\neg G$ we would stipulate some logical structure that the English sentence does not display and would wrongly deem the argument to be valid.

\factoidbox{When symbolizing sentences do only introduce logical structure that is displayed by the English sentence}

If you wish to make the information that in the specific circumstances `bad' means that something is not good and vice versa available in TFL, you can add this as an additional premises when symbolizing the relevant argument in TFL. That, is if we think that \ref{not7} is the negation of \ref{not6} we should add the following premise (using truth tables check that the premise is true, if and only if, `$\enot G$' is true whenever `$B$' is true): $$(\enot G\eif B)\eand (B\eif \enot G).$$ If this premise is added to the above argument, then the argument is valid and rightly so!

Sometimes even in symbolizing sentences that very much look like they are negations of each other one needs to be careful. Consider:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{not8}] Jane is happy.
		\item[\ex{not9}] Jane is unhappy.
	\end{earg}
To some it may feel like Jane can be neither happy nor unhappy, and this may even be assumed in some argument. Jane is without emotions and in a state of blank indifference: she does not feel happy nor does she feel unhappy. If we were to symbolize \ref{not8} by `$H$' and then \ref{not9} by `$\enot H$', then we would rule out the possibility of Jane being neither happy nor unhappy. If we try to remain faithful to the idea that Jane can be neither happy nor unhappy then we need to symbolize \ref{not9} using a new atomic sentence of TFL.

\section{Conjunction}
\label{s:ConnectiveConjunction}

The symbolization guideline for conjunction we introduced Section \ref{sec:tt} was:.

	\factoidbox{
%		A sentence can be symbolized as $(\metaX\eand\metaY)$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `Both\ldots, and\ldots', or as `\ldots, but \ldots', or as `although \ldots, \ldots'.
		If a sentence can be paraphrased as `\ldots and \ldots' \\it can be symbolised as $(\metaX\eand\metaY)$.
	}

%Notice that we make no attempt to symbolize the word `also' in sentence \ref{and3}. Words like `both' and `also' function to draw our attention to the fact that two things are being conjoined. Maybe they affect the emphasis of a sentence, but we will not (and cannot) symbolize such things in TFL.

Let's look at some more examples:
	\begin{earg}
	        \item[\ex{and3}]Adam is athletic, and Barbara is also athletic.
		\item[\ex{and4}]Barbara is athletic and energetic.
		\item[\ex{and5}]Barbara and Adam are both athletic.
		\item[\ex{and6}]Although Barbara is energetic, she is not athletic.
	\item[\ex{and7}]Adam is athletic, but Barbara is more athletic than him.
	\end{earg}

Let's fix the following symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[A] Adam is athletic.
		\item[B] Barbara is athletic.
		\item[C] Barbara ie energetic.
	\end{ekey}
Sentences \ref{and3}-\ref{and5} are obviously conjunctions. Notice that we make no attempt to symbolize the word `also' in sentence \ref{and3} and `both' in sentence \ref{and5}. Words like `both' and `also' function to draw our attention to the fact that two things are being conjoined. Maybe they affect the emphasis of a sentence, but we will not (and cannot) symbolize such things in TFL. With this caveat, given the above symbolization key, we can symbolize the Sentence \ref{and3} by the TFL-sentence `$A\eand B$'.

Sentence \ref{and4} says two things (about Barbara). In English, it is permissible to refer to Barbara only once. It \emph{might} be tempting to think that we need to symbolize sentence \ref{and4} with something along the lines of `$B$ and energetic'. This would be a mistake. Once we symbolize part of a sentence as $B$, any further structure is lost, as $B$ is an atomic sentence of TFL. Conversely, `energetic' is not an English sentence at all. What we are aiming for is something like `$B$ and Barbara is energetic'. Given our symbolization key we should thus symbolize \ref{and4} as $(B\eand C)$.

Sentence \ref{and5} says one thing about two different subjects. It says of both Barbara and Adam that they are athletic, even though in English we use the word `athletic' only once. The sentence can be paraphrased as `Barbara is athletic, and Adam is athletic'. We can symbolize this in TFL as $(B\eand A)$, using the same symbolization key that we have been using.

Are Sentences \ref{and6} and \ref{and7} conjuctions? The word `although' sets up a contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part. Nevertheless, the sentence tells us both that Barbara is energetic and that she is not athletic. In order to make each of the conjuncts an atomic sentence, we need to replace `she' with `Barbara'. So we can paraphrase sentence \ref{and6} as, `Barbara is energetic, \emph{and} Barbara is not athletic'. The second conjunct contains a negation, so we paraphrase further: `Barbara is energetic \emph{and} \emph{it is not the case that} Barbara is athletic'. Now we can symbolize this with the TFL sentence $(C\eand\enot B)$. Note that we have lost all sorts of nuance in this symbolization. There is a distinct difference in tone between sentence \ref{and6} and `Both Barbara is energetic and it is not the case that Barbara is athletic'. TFL does not (and cannot) preserve these nuances.

Sentence \ref{and7} raises similar issues. There is a contrastive structure, but this is not something that TFL can deal with. So we can paraphrase the sentence as `Adam is athletic, \emph{and} Barbara is more athletic than Adam'. (Notice that we once again replace the pronoun `him' with `Adam'.) How should we deal with the second conjunct? We already have the sentence letter $A$, which is being used to symbolize `Adam is athletic', and the sentence $B$ which is being used to symbolize `Barbara is athletic'; but neither of these concerns their relative athleticity. So, to symbolize the entire sentence, we need a new sentence letter. Let the TFL sentence $R$ symbolize the English sentence `Barbara is more athletic than Adam'. Now we can symbolize sentence \ref{and7} by $(A \eand R)$.

We can add these to our toolbox for symbolisation:
	\factoidbox{
		If a sentence can be paraphrased as \begin{itemize}
		\item `\ldots and \ldots'
		\item `\ldots but \ldots'
		\item `Both\ldots and \ldots'
		\item `Although \ldots, \ldots'
		\end{itemize} it can be symbolised as $\metaX\eand\metaY$.
	}

\section{Disjunction}
In Section \ref{sec:tt} proposed that:
\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased as `\ldots or \ldots' \\it can be symbolised as $(\metaX\eor\metaY)$.
	}
Let's consider some examples again
\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{or1}] Fatima will play videogames, or she will watch movies.
		\item[\ex{or2}] Fatima or Omar will play videogames.
	\end{earg}
with the symbolization key
\begin{ekey}
		\item[F] Fatima will play videogames.
		\item[O] Omar will play videogames.
		\item[M] Fatima will watch movies.
	\end{ekey}

In Chapter \ref{sec:tt} we already point out that here are two different reading available for the English word `or': an \emph{inclusive} one and an \emph{exclusive} one. On the inclusive reading of `or' we take the Sentence \ref{or2} to be true, if either Fatima or Omar play videogames, or both play videogames. In contrast, on the exclusive reading we take \ref{or2} to be true if either Fatima or Omar play videogames, but false if both play video games. It is the inclusive reading of `or' that we symbolize using the TFL-connective $\eor$.

For Sentence \ref{or2} the inclusive reading is available and using the above symbolization key it can be symbolized as $F\eor O$. For Sentence \ref{or1} it seems that the salient understanding of the sentence points to the exclusive reading: presumably Fatima cannot play videogames and watch movies at the same time. In fact the reason why we tend to understand Sentence \ref{or1} in that way is, arguably, precisely because we think that Fatima cannot do two things at once, and not because of our understanding of `or'. As a consequence when, in the context of an argument, we symbolize the Sentence \ref{or1} it is still preferable to symbolize it using the inclusive `or' as `$F\eor M$' and to add the additional premise that she does not do both, that is `$\enot(F\eand M)$'.

In contrast consider the sentence:
\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{eor1}] Either Fatima will play videogames, or she will watch movies.
		\item[\ex{eor2}] Either Fatima will play videogames or Omar will play videogames.
	\end{earg}

It seems that `\emph{either\ldots or\ldots}' in contrast to simple disjunction with `\emph{or}', favors an exclusive reading. So unless, there is strong evidence to suspect that sentences \ref{eor1} and \ref{eor2} are to be understood in an inclusive way, they should be symbolized using the exclusive `or'.

How do we symbolize the exclusive `or' in TFL? Understood exclusively Sentence \ref{eor1} can be paraphrased as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fatima will play videogames or Omar will play videogames, but not both of them will play videogames.
\end{itemize}
Using our symbolization key we can symbolize the first part of sentence, that is, the part up to the comma as `$F\eor O$'. Since by our previous discussion we know  that `but' should be symbolized by a conjunction it remains to see how to symbolize `not both of them will play videogames'. Going back to our discussion of negation and conjunction we see that the latter sentence is appropriately symbolized by the sentence $\enot(F\eand O)$. Putting everything together Sentence \ref{eor2} should be symbolized by the sentence $$(F\eor O)\eand\enot(F\eand O).$$

\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased in English as `\emph{either \ldots or \ldots}', \\it can be symbolised as $((\metaX\eor\metaY)\eand\enot(\metaX\eand\metaY))$.
	}

Finally notice that in English `\emph{neither\ldots nor\ldots}' is used to negate a disjunction, that is, using our symbolization key the sentences
\begin{itemize}
\item Neither Fatima nor Omar will play videogames.
\item Neither Fatima will play videogames nor Omar will play videogames.
\item  Neither Fatima will play videogames nor will Omar.
\end{itemize}
should all be symbolized by the TFL sentence `$\enot(F\eor O)$'.
\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased in English as\\`\emph{neither \ldots nor \ldots}', it can be symbolised as $\enot(\metaX\eor\metaY)$.}



\section{Conditional}
Let us again recall the symbolization guideline that we introduced in Section \ref{sec:tt}:
	\factoidbox{
	 If a sentence can be paraphrased as \\`\emph{If \ldots, then \ldots}' it can be symbolised as $(\metaX\eif\metaY)$.
	}


\noindent Now consider the sentences
\begin{earg}
	\item[\ex{if1}] If the number can be divided by 4, then it is even. 
		\item[\ex{if3}] If it can be divided by 4, it is even. 
		\item[\ex{if4}] It is an even number if it can be divided by 4.
\end{earg}

and use the following symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[P] The number can be divided by 4.
		\item[F] The number is an even number.
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{if3} and \ref{if4} are just a rephrasing of \ref{if1}. So we will again symbolise them as $(P\eif F)$.

Now consider
\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{if2}] The number is an even number only if the number can be divided by 4.
\end{earg}

\ref{if2} is also a conditional. But, intuitively, while \ref{if1}--\ref{if3} are true \ref{if4} is false, as, e.g., 6 is an even number but cannot be divided by 4. This suggest that \ref{if4} needs to be symbolized differently than \ref{if1}--\ref{if3}. Indeed, `only if' inverses the order of the conditional: whereas \ref{if1}--\ref{if3} are symbolized as $(P\eif F)$, \ref{if4} needs to be symbolized as $(F\eif P)$. Reflecting on the truth table of the conditional, $F\eif P$ says, assuming our symbolization key, that if $F$ is true, that if it is true that the number is even, then $P$ must be true for the conditional to be true, i.e., the number must be divisible by 4. That's of course not always the case, so the truth conditions for \ref{if2} fits with our intuitive judgement.


% In \ref{if1}--\ref{if4} we took as an antecedent the part of sentence that immediately succeeded the word `if'. It might then be tempting to do the same here and symbolize this as $(P\eif F)$. That would be a mistake. Your knowledge of geography tells you that sentence \ref{if1} is unproblematically true: there is no way for Jean to be in Paris that doesn't involve Jean being in France. But sentence \ref{if2} is not so straightforward: were  Jean in Dieppe, Lyons, or Toulouse, Jean would be in France without being in Paris, thereby rendering sentence \ref{if2} false. Since geography alone dictates the truth of sentence \ref{if1}, whereas travel plans (say) are needed to know the truth of sentence \ref{if2}, they must mean different things.
In fact, sentence \ref{if2} can be paraphrased as `If Jean is in France, then Jean is in Paris'. So we can symbolize it by $(F \eif P)$: the other way around to \ref{if1}.
	\factoidbox{
	 If a sentence can be paraphrased as \begin{itemize}
	 \item `If $\ldots_{X}$, then $\ldots_{Y}$'
	 \item `If $\ldots_{X}$, $\ldots_{Y}$'
	 \item `$\ldots_{Y}$ if $\ldots_{X}$'
	 \item `$\ldots_{X}$ only if $\ldots_{Y}$'
	 \end{itemize} it can be symbolized as $(\metaX\eif\metaY)$ such that $X$ assumes the position of $\ldots_X$ and $Y$ that of $\ldots_Y$.
	}
	
	
	\noindent Following this guidance, we symbolise all the following as `$A\eif B$':
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{ifthen1}] \mainconnective{If} Alice is on shift \mainconnective{then} Beth is on shift.
		\item[\ex{ifthen2}]  Beth is on shift \mainconnective{if} Alice is.
		\item[\ex{ifthen3}]  Alice is on shift \mainconnective{only if} Beth is.
	\end{earg}

 At this point, a word of warning about the connective `\eif'  seems required: while the connectives like `\eand' and `\eor' arguable closely track our understanding of `\emph{and}' and `\emph{or}' in natural language, the situation is slightly more complicated with respect to `\eif' and `\emph{if\ldots, then\ldots}' as we discussed in \S\ref{s:IndicativeSubjunctive}.\todo{ and \ref{s:ParadoxesOfMaterialConditional}.}

\section{Biconditional}
In this textbook we have frequently used the English expression `\emph{if and only if}', as in: an atomic sentence $\metaX$ is true relative to a valuation $v$ \emph{if and only if} $v$ assigns the value T to $X$. `\emph{if and only if}' seems to be another conjunction word of English, that is, a way of composing two sentences into a new sentence. Is there a way to symbolize sentences of the form `\emph{\ldots if and only if\ldots}' in TFL?

Consider the sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{iff1}] Laika is a dog only if she is a mammal
		\item[\ex{iff2}] Laika is a dog if she is a mammal
		\item[\ex{iff3}] Laika is a dog if and only if she is a mammal
	\end{earg}
We will use the following symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[D] Laika is a dog
		\item[M] Laika is a mammal
	\end{ekey}
Sentence \ref{iff1}, for reasons discussed above, can be symbolized by `$D \eif M$'. in contrast Sentence \ref{iff2} can be paraphrased as, `If Laika is a mammal then Laika is a dog'. So it can be symbolized by `$M \eif D$'.

Sentence \ref{iff3} says something stronger than both \ref{iff1} and \ref{iff2}. It can be paraphrased as `Laika is a dog if Laika is a mammal, and Laika is a dog only if Laika is a mammal'. This is just the conjunction of sentences \ref{iff1} and \ref{iff2}. So we can symbolize it as `$((D \eif M) \eand (M \eif D))$'. We call this a \define{biconditional}, because it entails the conditional in both directions. This leads to the following symbolization guideline:

\newglossaryentry{biconditional}
{
name=biconditional,
description={The symbol \eiff, used to represent words and phrases that function like the English phrase ``if and only if''; or a sentence formed using this connective.}}


\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased as `$\ldots_x$ if and only if $\ldots_y$'\\ it can be symbolised as $((\metaX\eif\metaY)\eand(\metaY\eif\metaX))$.
	}
The expression `if and only if' occurs a lot especially in philosophy, mathematics, and logic. For brevity, we can abbreviate it with the snappier word `iff'. We will follow this practice. So `if' with only \emph{one} `f' is the English conditional. But `iff' with \emph{two} `f's is the English biconditional. Because the biconditional occurs so often, we will sometimes abbreviate the lengthy `$(\metaX\eif\metaY)\eand(\metaY\eif\metaX)$' and write $\metaX\eiff\metaY$ instead. However, officially the symbol `\eiff' is not a symbol of the language of TFL. It is merely used as a convenient way to state a biconditional and it is good to keep that in mind.

\begin{highlighted}
	$(\metaX\eiff\metaY)$ is an abbreviation for $((\metaX\eif\metaY)\eand(\metaY\eif\metaX))$.
\end{highlighted}

\textbf{A word of caution.} Ordinary speakers of English often use `if \ldots, then\ldots' when they really mean to use something more like `\ldots if and only if \ldots'. Perhaps your parents told you, when you were a child: `if you don't eat your greens, you won't get any dessert'. Suppose you ate your greens, but that your parents refused to give you any dessert, on the grounds that they were only committed to the \emph{conditional} (roughly `if you get dessert, then you will have eaten your greens'), rather than the biconditional (roughly, `you get dessert iff you eat your greens'). Well, a tantrum would rightly ensue. So, be aware of this when interpreting people; but in your own writing, make sure you use the biconditional iff you mean to.

\section{Unless}
A difficult case is when we use the conjunction word `unless':

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{unless1}] Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold.
\item[\ex{unless2}] You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket.
\end{earg}
These two sentences are equivalent. They are also equivalent to the following:
\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{unless3}]  If you do not wear a jacket, then you will catch a cold.
\item[\ex{unless4}]  If you do not catch a cold, then you wore a jacket.
\item [\ex{unless5}] Either you will wear a jacket or you will catch a cold.
\end{earg}
And we know how to symbolise these sentences. We will use the symbolization key:
	\begin{ekey}
		\item[J] You will wear a jacket.
		\item[D] You will catch a cold.
	\end{ekey} and can then give the symbolizations `$\enot J \eif D$', `$\enot D \eif J$' and `$J \eor D$'.

All three are correct symbolizations. Indeed, in you may wish to check that all three symbolizations are equivalent in TFL.
% TODO: it might be useful to reference exercise 11.F.3 explicitly
% here, since the point is not discussed in the main text
	\factoidbox{
		If a sentence can be paraphrased as `\emph{Unless \ldots, \ldots}', \\then it can be symbolized as $(\metaX\eor\metaY)$.
	}
Again, though, there is a little complication. `Unless' can be symbolized as a conditional; but as we said above, people often use the conditional (on its own) when they mean to use the biconditional. Equally, `unless' can be symbolized as a disjunction; but there are two kinds of disjunction (exclusive and inclusive). So it will not surprise you to discover that ordinary speakers of English often use `unless' to mean something more like the biconditional, or like exclusive disjunction. Suppose someone says: `I will go running unless it rains'. They probably mean something like `I will go running iff it does not rain' (i.e.\ the biconditional), or  `either I will go running or it will rain, but not both' (i.e.\ exclusive disjunction). Again: be aware of this when interpreting what other people have said, but be precise in your writing.

\section{More on Connectives in English}
We have discussed several conjunction-words and sentence constructions that can be aptly symbolized in TFL. 

In fact, TFL has the resources to express any \emph{truth-functional} connective of English, possibly by a more complex sentence, as we did for, for example, exclusive `or' or `if and only if'. 

However, there are of course many more conjunction-words in English and some of them can be adequately symbolized in TFL. However, there are also many conjunction words that cannot be adequately symbolized in TFL. We shall discuss some examples in Chapter \ref{s:TruthFunctionality}.

\chapter{Ambiguity}\label{s:AmbiguityTFL}

In English, sentences can be \define{ambiguous}, i.e., they can have more than one meaning.  There are many sources of ambiguity. One is \emph{lexical ambiguity:} a sentence can contain words which have more than one meaning.  For instance, `bank' can mean the bank of a river, or a financial institution. So I might say that `I went to the bank' when I took a stroll along the river, or when I went to deposit a check.  Depending on the situation, a different meaning of `bank' is intended, and so the sentence, when uttered in these different contexts, expresses different meanings.

A different kind of ambiguity is \emph{structural ambiguity}.  This arises when a sentence can be interpreted in different ways, and depending on the interpretation, a different meaning is selected.  A famous example due to Noam Chomsky is the following:
\begin{earg}
	\prem Flying planes can be dangerous.
\end{earg}
There is one reading in which `flying' is used as an adjective which modifies `planes'. In this sense, what's claimed to be dangerous are airplanes which are in the process of flying.  In another reading, `flying' is a gerund: what's claimed to be dangerous is the act of flying a plane.  In the first case, you might use the sentence to warn someone who's about to launch a hot air balloon.  In the second case, you might use it to counsel someone against becoming a pilot.

When the sentence is uttered, usually only one meaning is intended. Which of the possible meanings an utterance of a sentence intends is determined by context, or sometimes by how it is uttered (which parts of the sentence are stressed, for instance). Often one interpretation is much more likely to be intended, and in that case it will even be difficult to ``see'' the unintended reading.  This is often the reason why a joke works, as in this example from Groucho Marx:
\begin{earg}
	\prem One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
	\prem How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
\end{earg}

Ambiguity is related to, but not the same as, vagueness. An adjective, for instance `rich' or `tall,' is \define{vague} when it is not always possible to determine if it applies or not.  For instance, a person who's 6~ft 4~in (1.9~m) tall is pretty clearly tall, but a building that size is tiny.  Here, context has a role to play in determining what the clear cases and clear non-cases are (`tall for a person,' `tall for a basketball player,' `tall for a building'). Even when the context is clear, however, there will still be cases that fall in a middle range.

In TFL, we generally aim to avoid ambiguity. We will try to give our symbolization keys in such a way that they do not use ambiguous words or  disambiguate them if a word has different meanings. So, e.g., your symbolization key will need two different sentence letters for `Rebecca went to the (money) bank' and `Rebecca went to the (river) bank.' Vagueness is harder to avoid. Since we have stipulated that every case (and later, every valuation) must make every basic sentence (or sentence letter) either true or false and nothing in between, we cannot accommodate borderline cases in TFL.

It is an important feature of sentences of TFL that they \emph{cannot} be structurally ambiguous. Every sentence of TFL can be read in one, and only one, way. This feature of TFL is also a strength. If an English sentence is ambiguous, TFL can help us make clear what the different meanings are.  Although we are pretty good at dealing with ambiguity in everyday conversation, avoiding it can sometimes be terribly important. Logic can then be usefully applied: it helps philosopher express their thoughts clearly, mathematicians to state their theorems rigorously, and software engineers to specify loop conditions, database queries, or verification criteria unambiguously.

Stating things without ambiguity is of crucial importance in the law as well. Here, ambiguity can, without exaggeration, be a matter of life and death. Here is a famous example of where a death sentence hinged on the interpretation of an ambiguity in the law. Roger Casement (1864--1916) was a British diplomat who was famous in his time for publicizing human-rights violations in the Congo and Peru (for which he was knighted in 1911). He was also an Irish nationalist. In 1914--16, Casement secretly travelled to Germany, with which Britain was at war at the time, and tried to recruit Irish prisoners of war to fight against Britain and for Irish independence. Upon his return to Ireland, he was captured by the British and tried for high treason.

The law under which Casement was tried is the \emph{Treason Act of 1351}. That act specifies what counts as treason, and so the prosecution had to establish at trial that Casement's actions met the criteria set forth in the Treason Act. The relevant passage stipulated that someone is guilty of treason
\begin{quote}
	if a man is adherent to the King's enemies in his
realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere.
\end{quote}
Casement's defense hinged on the last comma in this sentence, which is not present in the original French text of the law from 1351.  It was not under dispute that Casement had been `adherent to the King's enemies', but the question was whether being adherent to the King's enemies constituted treason only when it was done in the realm, or also when it was done abroad. The defense argued that the law was ambiguous. The claimed ambiguity hinged on whether `or elsewhere' attaches only to `giving aid and comfort to the King's enemies' (the natural reading without the comma), or to both `being adherent to the King's enemies' and `giving aid and comfort to the King's enemies' (the natural reading with the comma).  Although the former interpretation might seem far fetched, the argument in its favor was actually not unpersuasive. Nevertheless, the court decided that the passage should be read with the comma, so Casement's antics in Germany were treasonous, and he was sentenced to death. Casement himself wrote that he was `hanged by a comma'.

We can use TFL to symbolize both readings of the passage, and thus to provide a disambiguiation. First, we need a symbolization key:
\begin{ekey}
	\item[A] Casement was adherent to the King's enemies in the realm.
	\item[G] Casement gave aid and comfort to the King's enemies in the realm.
	\item[B] Casement was adherent to the King's enemies abroad.
	\item[H] Casement gave aid and comfort to the King's enemies abroad.
\end{ekey}
The interpretation according to which Casement's behavior was not treasonous is this:
\begin{earg}
	\prem $A \lor (G \lor H)$
\end{earg}
The interpretation which got him executed, on the other hand, can be symbolized by:
\begin{earg}
	\prem $(A \lor B) \lor (G \lor H)$
\end{earg}
Remember that in the case we're dealing with Casement, was adherent to the King's enemies abroad ($B$ is true), but not in the realm, and he did not give the King's enemies aid or comfort in or outside the realm ($A$, $G$, and~$H$ are false).

One common source of structural ambiguity in English arises from its lack of parentheses. For instance, if I say `I like movies that are not long and boring', you will most likely think that what I dislike are movies that are long and boring. A less likely, but possible, interpretation is that I like movies that are both (a) not long and (b) boring. The first reading is more likely because who likes boring movies? But what about `I like dishes that are not sweet and flavorful'? Here, the more likely interpretation is that I like savory, flavorful dishes.  (Of course, I could have said that better, e.g., `I like dishes that are not sweet, yet flavorful'.) Similar ambiguities result from the interaction of `and' with `or'. For instance, suppose I ask you to send me a picture of a small and dangerous or stealthy animal.  Would a leopard count? It's stealthy, but not small. So it depends whether I'm looking for small animals that are dangerous or stealthy (leopard doesn't count), or whether I'm after either a small, dangerous animal or a stealthy animal (of any size).

These kinds of ambiguities are called \emph{scope ambiguities}, since they depend on whether or not a connective is in the scope of another. For instance, the sentence, `\emph{Avengers: Endgame} is not long and boring' is ambiguous between:
\begin{earg}
	\item[\ex{scamb1}] \emph{Avengers: Endgame} is not: both long and boring.
	\item[\ex{scamb2}] \emph{Avengers: Endgame} is both: not long and boring.
\end{earg}
Sentence~\ref{scamb2} is certainly false, since \emph{Avengers: Endgame} is over three hours long. Whether you think~\ref{scamb1} is true depends on if you think it is boring or not. We can use the symbolization key:
\begin{ekey}
	\item[B] \emph{Avengers: Endgame} is boring.
	\item[L] \emph{Avengers: Endgame} is long.
\end{ekey}
Sentence~\ref{scamb1} can now be symbolized as `$\enot(L \eand B)$', whereas sentence~\ref{scamb2} would be `$\enot L \eand B$'. In the first case, the `\eand' is in the scope of `\enot', in the second case `\enot' is in the scope of `\eand'.

The sentence `Tai Lung is small and dangerous or stealthy' is ambiguous between:
\begin{earg}
	\item[\ex{scamb3}] Tai Lung is either both small and dangerous or stealthy.
	\item[\ex{scamb4}] Tai Lung is both small and either dangerous or stealthy.
\end{earg}
We can use the following symbolization key:
\begin{ekey}
	\item[D] Tai Lung is dangerous.
	\item[S] Tai Lung is small.
	\item[T] Tai Lung is stealthy.
\end{ekey}
The symbolization of sentence~\ref{scamb3} is `$(S \eand D) \eor T$' and that of sentence~\ref{scamb4} is `$S \eand (D \eor T)$'. In the first, \eand is in the scope of \eor, and in the second \eor is in the scope of \eand.

%\chapter{TFL vs English connectives }\label{s:ParadoxesOfMaterialConditional}
%\teachingnote{Not covered in this course. This is just a taster for students who are interested.\\}
%Consider the sentence:
%	\begin{earg}
%		\item[\ex{n:JanBald}] Jan is neither bald nor not-bald.
%	\end{earg}
%To symbolize this sentence in TFL, we would offer something like `$\enot J \eand \enot \enot J$'. This a contradiction (check this with a truth-table), but sentence \ref{n:JanBald} does not itself seem like a contradiction; for we might have happily go on to add `Jan is on the borderline of baldness'!
%
%Third, consider the following sentence:
%	\begin{earg}
%		\item[\ex{n:GodParadox}]	It's not the case that, if God exists, She answers malevolent prayers.
%%	Aaliyah wants to kill Zebedee. She knows that, if she puts chemical A into Zebedee's water bottle, Zebedee will drink the contaminated water and die. Equally, Bathsehba wants to kill Zebedee. She knows that, if she puts chemical B into Zebedee's water bottle, then Zebedee will drink the contaminated water and die. But chemicals A and B neutralize each other; so that if both are added to the water bottle, then Zebedee will not die.
%	\end{earg}
%        Symbolizing this in TFL, we would offer something like `$\enot (G \eif M)$'. Now, `$\enot (G \eif M)$' entails `$G$' (again, check this with a truth table). So if we symbolize sentence \ref{n:GodParadox} in TFL, it seems to entail that God exists. But that's strange: surely even an atheist can accept sentence \ref{n:GodParadox}, without contradicting herself!
%
%        One lesson of this is that the symbolization of \ref{n:GodParadox} as `$\enot(G \eif M)$' shows that \ref{n:GodParadox} does not express what we intend. Perhaps we should rephrase it as
%        	\begin{earg}
%                \item[\ex{n:GodParadox2}] If God exists, She does not answer malevolent prayers.
%  \end{earg}
%and symbolize \ref{n:GodParadox2} as `$G \eif \enot M$'.  Now, if atheists are right, and there is no God, then `$G$' is false and so `$G \eif \enot M$' is true, and the puzzle disappears. However, if `$G$' is false, `$G \eif M$', i.e.\ `If God exists, She answers malevolent prayers', is \emph{also} true!
%
%In different ways, these  examples highlight some of the limits of working with a language (like TFL) that can \emph{only} handle truth-functional connectives. Moreover, these limits give rise to some interesting questions in philosophical logic. The case of Jan's baldness (or otherwise) raises the general question of what logic we should use when dealing with \emph{vague} discourse. The case of the atheist raises the question of how to deal with the (so-called) \emph{paradoxes of the material conditional}. Part of the purpose of this course is to equip you with the tools to explore these questions of \emph{philosophical logic}. But we have to walk before we can run; we have to become proficient in using TFL, before we can adequately discuss its limits, and consider alternatives.

\section{Limits of Symbolization in TFL}
All of the connectives of TFL are truth-functional, but more than that: they really do nothing \emph{but} map us between truth values. When we symbolize a sentence or an argument in TFL, we ignore everything \emph{besides} the contribution that the truth values of a component might make to the truth value of the whole. There are subtleties to our ordinary claims that far outstrip their mere truth values. Sarcasm; poetry; snide implicature; emphasis; these are important parts of everyday discourse, but none of this is retained in TFL. As remarked in \S\ref{sec:symbcon}, TFL cannot capture the subtle differences between the following English sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item Dana is a logician and Dana is a nice person
		\item Although Dana is a logician, Dana is a nice person
		\item Dana is a logician despite being a nice person
		\item Dana is a nice person, but also a logician
		\item Dana's being a logician notwithstanding, he is a nice person
	\end{earg}
All of the above sentences will be symbolized with the same TFL sentence, perhaps `$L \eand N$'. This does not mean that there are no subtle differences between those sentences. It just means that from the perspective of TFL, they should be symbolized by the same TFL-sentence and that TFL is ignorant of these subtle differences.

%We keep saying that we use TFL sentences to \emph{symbolize} English sentences.
