When a year is finished an an edition needs to be released.


1. Produce final archived versions.

In /setup/meta.sty toggle \finalversiontrue
Push changes so github runs the action and compiles it and archives it.

2. Publish a release with the list of major changes `https://github.com/catrincm/forallx-bris/releases`

3. Update details in /setup/ for next year
Remove \finalversiontrue so we're in in-progress
Update year details in /setup/meta.sty and /setup/academic-year.txt
