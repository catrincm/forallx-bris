\chapter{Arguments}
\label{s:Arguments}

Much of philosophical practice is about argument and
analysis. 
Arguing in support of or against some position, or understanding someone else's argument. 
Logic is the study of the practice of argument and
analysis, abstracted from the specific details of a
particular case.



In everyday language, we sometimes use the word `argument' to talk about belligerent shouting matches.  If you and a friend have an argument in this sense, things are not going well between the two of you. Logic is not concerned with such teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling. They are not arguments, in our sense; they are disagreements.

Logic provides the ideal model of good argument:
rational argument without rhetoric.
The logical study of an argument can show whether it
supports its conclusion or is flawed.
Logic focuses only on the statements presented and the
relationships between them.
Extraneous factors are set aside: unspoken assumptions,
additional connotations of words, appeal to emotions.

 Logical thinking can help us to work out the intended
interpretation of a text, and to find alternative
unintended interpretations.
 This can be helpful when reading someone else’s
writing, and essential when we are trying to write
unambiguously.
 Logical analysis can help us to find ambiguity and
alternative interpretations, and to write in a precise and
unambiguous way that can only be interpreted as we
intend.



An argument, as we will understand it, is something more like this:\todo{get a better argument!}
	\begin{earg}\label{argRaining}
		\item[] It will rain today.
		\item[] If it will rain today, then you should take an umbrella. 
		\item[]Therefore: You should take an umbrella.
	\end{earg}
We here have a series of sentences which may either be true or false. The final sentence expresses the \emph{conclusion} of the argument. The two sentences before that are the \emph{premises} of the argument. In a good argument, the conclusion follows from the premises. If you believe the premises then the argument should lead you to believing the conclusion.

%One of the main things we will do is to give tools to understand the structure of arguments and whether it has a g

This Part discusses some basic logical notions that apply to arguments in a natural language like English. It is important to begin with a clear understanding of what arguments are and of what it means for an argument to be valid. Later we will translate arguments from English into a formal language. We want formal validity, as defined in the formal language, to have at least some of the important features of natural-language validity. 


\section{Sentences}
\label{intro.sentences}

An argument is a relationship between sentences which can either be true or false, for example `Kierkegaard was a hunchback' or `Kierkegaard liked almonds'. Sentences that are true or false are called \emph{declarative sentences}. In what follows we will focus exclusively on declarative sentences, and we will simply call them `sentences'. There are things that would count as `sentences' in a linguistics or grammar course that we will not count as sentences in logic.

\begin{description}
\item[{Questions}] In a grammar class, `Are you sleepy yet?' would count as an interrogative sentence. Although you might be sleepy or you might be alert, the question itself is neither true nor false. For this reason, questions will not count as sentences in logic. Suppose you answer the question: `I am not sleepy.' This is either true or false, and so it is a sentence in the logical sense. Generally, \emph{questions} will not count as sentences, but \emph{answers} will. 

`What is this course about?' is not a sentence (in our sense). `No one knows what this course is about' is a sentence.

\item[{Imperatives}] Commands are often phrased as imperatives like `Wake up!', `Sit up straight', and so on. In a grammar class, these would count as imperative sentences. Although it might be good for you to sit up straight or it might not, the command is neither true nor false. Note, however, that commands are not always phrased as imperatives. `You will respect my authority' \emph{is} either true or false--- either you will or you will not--- and so it counts as a sentence in the logical sense.

\item[{Exclamations}] `Ouch!' is sometimes called an exclamatory sentence, but it is neither true nor false. We will treat `Ouch, I hurt my toe!' as meaning the same thing as `I hurt my toe.' The `ouch' does not add anything that could be true or false.
\end{description}

%Some sentences depend on context for whether they are true or false. For example the truth of `I have long hair' depends on who is uttering it. Sometimes we will use examples where the context does matter. Everything that we say, though, still holds when the context is held fixed throughout the course of the argument.




In English, sentences can be \emph{ambiguous}. There are many sources of ambiguity. One is \emph{lexical ambiguity:} a sentence can contain words which have more than one meaning.  For instance, `bank' can mean the bank of a river, or a financial institution. So I might say that `Katie went to the bank' when she took a stroll along the river, or when she went to deposit a check.  When we talk about sentences, we assume that all words have been disambiguated and it is settled whether `bank' is somewhere you have a picnic or where you deposit your money.

\todo{Indexicals and context dependence?}


\section{Finding the components of an argument}


An argument, as we understand it, is a series of sentences, the \emph{premises}, followed by a single sentence, the \emph{conclusion}. 

\begin{earg}\label{argRaining}
	\item[] It will rain today.
	\item[] If it will rain today, then you should take an umbrella. 
	\item[\therefore] You should take an umbrella.
\end{earg}
The three dots in this final line should be read ``therefore''. It is our concise way to identify the conclusion of the argument. 

But arguments are often not presented in this form. 
When approaching an argument, the first thing to do is to separate out the conclusion from the premises. What is the argument an argument for?
The premises and arguments aren't always as nicely packaged up as they were in our example argument. Sometimes a single sentence can contain a complete argument. Consider:
	\begin{quote}
		 I was wearing my sunglasses; so it must have been sunny.
	\end{quote}
This argument has one premise (I was wearing my sunglasses) followed by a conclusion (it was sunny). 

Many arguments start with premises, and end with a conclusion, but not all of them. The argument with which this section began might equally have been presented with the conclusion at the beginning, like so:
	\begin{quote}
		\underline{You should take an umbrella.} After all, it is raining heavily. And if you do not take an umbrella, you will get soaked. 
	\end{quote}
Equally, it might have been presented with the conclusion in the middle:
	\begin{quote}
		It is raining heavily. Accordingly, \underline{you should take an umbrella}, given that if you do not take an umbrella, you will get soaked.
	\end{quote}

 As a guideline, the following words are often used to indicate an argument's conclusion:
	\begin{center}
		so, therefore, hence, thus, accordingly, consequently
	\end{center}
Similarly, these expressions often indicate that we are dealing with a premise, rather than a conclusion:
	\begin{center}
		since, because, given that
	\end{center}



Sometimes it can take some work to pick out what the conclusion of the argument is. 
Consider: 
%\begin{center}
%You have already said that you love me and that you can't imagine spending the rest of your life without me. Once you even tried to propose to me. And now you claim that you need time to think about whether we should be married. Well, everything you've told me regarding our relationship has been a lie. In some of your letters to a friend you admitted that you were misleading me. You've been telling everyone that we are just friends, not lovers. And worst of all, you've been secretly dating someone else. Why are you doing this? It's all been a farce, and I'm outta here. 
%\citet{vaughn}
%\end{center}
\begin{quote}
Virgin would then dominate the rail system. Is that something the government should worry about? Not necessarily. The industry is regulated, and one powerful company might at least offer a more coherent schedule of services than the present arrangement has produced. The reason the industry was broken up into more than 100 companies at privatisation was not operational, but political: the Conservative government thought it would thus be harder to renationalise. \emph{The Economist 16.12.2000; used on \href{https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/arg/arg.php}{critical thinking web}}
\end{quote}
The conclusion of this argument is that we shouldn't be worried if Virgin dominates the rail system. 

Another example:
\begin{quote}
Human beings have no free will because every event is
determined by the way the world was at the Big Bang,
and if humans have free will then there is an event that
was not determined by the way the world was at the Big
Bang.
\end{quote}
This argument can be stated explicitly:
\begin{earg}
\item Every event is determined by the way the world was at the Big
Bang
\item If humans have free will then there is an event that was not
determined by the way the world was at the Big Bang
\item Therefore: Human beings have no free will
\end{earg}

Often people aren't giving arguments but are simply presenting facts or stating their opinion.
For example, the following do not contain arguments, they're not trying to convince us of anything. 
\begin{ebullet}
\item I don't like cats. They're evil.
\item Hundreds of vulnerable children as young as 10, who have spent most of their lives in the UK, are having their applications for British citizenship denied for failing to pass the government's controversial `good character' test.
\end{ebullet}
One particular kind of sentence can be confusing. Consider: 
\begin{ebullet}
\item  If the murder weapon was a gun, then Prof. Plum did it.
\end{ebullet}These conditional, or ``if-then'', statements might look like it expresses the argument, but in itself it does not. It's just stating a fact, albeit a conditional fact. It might be used in an argument:
\begin{earg}
\item If the murder weapon was a gun, then Prof.~Plum did it.
\item The murder weapon was a gun.
\item[\therefore] Prof.~Plum did it.
\end{earg}

In analysing an argument, there is no substitute for a good nose. 


We have said arguments are just a list of premises and a conclusion. We might think of this as something like:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}

        \node[propn] (concln) {Conclusion};

        \coordinate (zJoin) at ([yshift=1cm]concln.north);
        
        \node[propn] (premise1) [above left=1.5cm and 1cm  of concln]{Premise 1};
        \node[propn] (premise2) [above right=1.5cm and 1cm of concln]{Premise 2};  
                \draw[joiningargout] (zJoin)--(concln);
                \draw[joiningargin] (premise1)--(zJoin);
                \draw[joiningargin] (premise2)--(zJoin);                
                  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}
Arguments as you read them in philosophy texts may have a more complicated structure, typically by chaining together simple arguments like this, so they may have \emph{intermediate conclusions}. They might have a structure more like:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
        \node[propn] (premise) {Premise 1};
          \node[propn] (premise2) [right=2cm of premise] {Premise 2};
        \node[propn] (intconclusion) [below right=1.5cm and 0cm of premise] {Intermediate Conclusion};
                  \coordinate (zJoin) at ([yshift=1cm]intconclusion.north);
        \draw[joiningargin] (premise)--(zJoin);
          \draw[joiningargin] (premise2)--(zJoin);
                  \draw[joiningargout] (zJoin)--(intconclusion);      
          \node[propn] (premise3) [right=1cm of intconclusion] {Premise 3};        
               \node[propn] (concln) [below right=1.5cm and 0cm of intconclusion] {Conclusion};
                     \coordinate (zJoin2) at ([yshift=1cm]concln.north);        
        \draw[joiningargin] (intconclusion)--(zJoin2);
          \draw[joiningargin] (premise3)--(zJoin2);
                  \draw[joiningargout] (zJoin2)--(concln);   
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
But we will analyse this simple structure to give us the tools to understand the more complex arguments as we will come across them throughout philosophy.

At the end of some chapters, there are problems that review and explore the material covered in the chapter. There is no substitute for actually working through some problems, because logic is more about a way of thinking than it is about memorizing facts.

Highlight the phrase which expresses the conclusion of each of these arguments:
\begin{earg}
	\item It is sunny. So I should take my sunglasses.
	\item It must have been sunny. I did wear my sunglasses, after all.
	\item No one but you has had their hands in the cookie-jar. And the scene of the crime is littered with cookie-crumbs. You're the culprit!
	\item Miss Scarlett and Professor Plum were in the study at the time of the murder. Reverend Green had the candlestick in the ballroom, and we know that there is no blood on his hands. Hence Colonel Mustard did it in the kitchen with the lead-piping. Recall, after all, that the gun had not been fired.
	\item Cutting the interest rate will have no effect on the stock market this time round as people have been expecting a rate cut all along. This factor has already been reflected in the market.
	\item There are no hard numbers, but the evidence from Asia's expatriate community is unequivocal. Three years after its handover from Britain to China, Hong Kong is unlearning English. The city's gweilos (Cantonese for "ghost men") must go to ever greater lengths to catch the oldest taxi driver available to maximize their chances of comprehension. Hotel managers are complaining that they can no longer find enough English- speakers to act as receptionists. Departing tourists, polled at the airport, voice growing frustration at not being understood. \\ \emph{The Economist 20.1.2001}, used in \href{https://philosophy.hku.hk/think/arg/arg.php}{Critical Thinking Web}

\chapter{Valid arguments}
\label{s:Valid}

\section{Validity}

An argument is just a series of sentences, called the premises, followed by a single sentence, called the conclusion.
The aim of an argument is that the premises should \emph{support} the conclusion. 

There are different ways that premises can support a conclusion. In logic we are interested in the strongest possible such relation: that if the premises are true, the conclusion \emph{must} be true. That it is impossible that the premises are true and conclusion false. We call such an argument \emph{valid}:

	\factoidbox{
		An argument is \define{valid} if and only if it is impossible for all of the premises to be true and the conclusion false.
	}

\newglossaryentry{valid}
{
name=valid,
description={A property of arguments where it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false}
}

\newglossaryentry{invalid}
{
name=invalid,
description={A property of arguments that holds when it is possible for the premises to be true without the conclusion being true; the opposite of \gls{valid}}
}

For example, the following is invalid:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] Jenny is miserable.
		\item[] If it is raining outside, then Jenny is miserable.
		\item[\therefore] It is raining outside.
	\end{earg}
This is invalid because it is possible that Jenny is miserable for some other reason. 

However, the following is valid:
\begin{earg}
	\item[] Professor Plum or Colonel Mustard are guilty. 
	\item[] Professor Plum is not guilty.
	\item[\therefore] Colonel Mustard is guilty. 
\end{earg}
It is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 

Consider this example:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
		\item[] Oranges are not fruits.
		\item[\therefore] Oranges are musical instruments.
	\end{earg}
The conclusion of this argument is ridiculous. Nevertheless, it follows from the premises. \emph{If} both premises were true, \emph{then} the conclusion just has to be true. So the argument is valid. 

This highlights that valid arguments do not need to have true premises or true conclusions. Conversely, having true premises and a true conclusion is not enough to make an argument valid. Consider this example:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] London is in England.
		\item[] Beijing is in China.
		\item[\therefore] Paris is in France.
	\end{earg}
The premises and conclusion of this argument are, as a matter of fact, all true, but the argument is invalid. If Paris were to declare independence from the rest of France, then the conclusion would be false, even though both of the premises would remain true. Thus, it is \emph{possible} for the premises of this argument to be true and the conclusion false. The argument is therefore invalid.

The important thing to remember is that validity is not about the actual truth or falsity of the sentences in the argument. It is about whether it is \emph{possible} for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 

To determine whether or not the premises of an argument are true is often a very important matter. However, that is normally a task best left to experts in the field: as it might be, historians, scientists, or whomever. In our role as \emph{logicians}, we are more concerned with arguments \emph{in general}. So we are (usually) more concerned with whether the argument is valid or not than whether its conclusion is true. Nonetheless, we will say that an argument is \define{sound} if and only if it is both valid and all of its premises are true. A sound argument must have a true conclusion. 

\begin{center}

  \begin{tikzpicture}

        \node[draw,shape=ellipse] (premise) {Premise};
        \node[draw,shape=ellipse] (conclusion) [below=2cm of premise] {Conclusion};
        \draw[->] (premise)--(conclusion);
        
        \node (arg) [below=1cm of premise] {};
        
        \node (labelpremise) [right=1cm of premise] {true};
        \node (labelarg) [below=1cm of labelpremise] {valid};
        
        \draw[->,decorate,decoration=snake] (labelpremise)--(premise);
        \draw[->,decorate,decoration=snake] (labelarg)--(arg);  
        
        				\node (bracetop) [above=.01cm of labelpremise.north east] {};
        				\node (bracebottom) [below=.01cm of labelarg.south east] {};        				
%        	       
        \draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt}]
        					(bracetop) -- (bracebottom) node [midway,align=center,xshift=1cm] {sound};         
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\newglossaryentry{sound}
{
name=sound,
description={A property of arguments that holds if the argument is valid and has all true premises}
}



So: we are interested in whether or not a conclusion \emph{follows from} some premises. 
Don't, though, say that the premises \emph{infer} the conclusion. Instead we say that the premises \define{entail} the conclusion. 
Entailment is a relation between premises and conclusions; inference is something we do. 
It would be correct to say that \emph{one may infer} the conclusion from the premises, but not simply that the premises infer the conclusion. 


\section{Missing premises}
One way that an argument can fail to be valid is if one
or more of its premises are missing, or suppressed, or
left implicit.

This is often done when the premise is thought to be
obvious and so doesn't need to be stated explicitly.

For example 
\begin{earg}
\item It is raining.
\item[\therefore] I should take my umbrella.
\end{earg}

This argument is invalid. But, it can be made valid by addition of the premise 
\begin{earg}
\item[] If it is raining, then I should take my umbrella.
\end{earg}
Or perhaps we can break it down further:\todo{???}
\begin{earg}
\item[] If it is raining and I don't have my umbrella, then I will get wet.
\item[] I don't want to get wet. 
\item[] If I don't want to get wet and by taking an umbrella I will not get wet, then I should take my umbrella.
\end{earg}


If someone you disagree with makes an invalid
argument, you might be tempted just to dismiss it as
obviously incorrect.
But it’s more useful (and more charitable) to consider
whether there are missing premises that could be filled
in that make the argument better.
Perhaps the speaker/author was assuming that this
premise was so obvious that it didn’t need to be stated.
But be careful when you’re filling in ‘missing’ premises.
The aim is to help improve the argument, to make it
more convincing, so you can assess it fairly.
Only add extra premises that seem reasonable, or that
the original speaker/author would agree with.
There’s no point in adding absurd or unreasonable
premises, or premises that the speaker/author wouldn’t
endorse. Then you just create a \emph{strawman} argument –
a caricature of the original argument.


\begin{quotation}
“Just how charitable are you supposed to be when criticizing the views of an opponent? If there are obvious contradictions in the opponent’s case, then of course you should point them out, forcefully. If there are somewhat hidden contradictions, you should carefully expose them to view—and then dump on them. But the search for hidden contradictions often crosses the line into nitpicking, sea-lawyering, and—as we have seen—outright parody. The thrill of the chase and the conviction that your opponent has to be harboring a confusion somewhere encourages uncharitable interpretation, which gives you an easy target to attack. But such easy targets are typically irrelevant to the real issues at stake and simply waste everybody’s time and patience, even if they give amusement to your supporters. ”\\
\emph{Daniel C. Dennett (2013). “Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking”. }
\end{quotation}


Dennett formulates the following four rules (named after
Anatol Rapoport) for “how to compose a successful critical
commentary”:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so
clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I
wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”
\item You should list any points of agreement (especially if they
are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
\item You should mention anything you have learned from your
target.
\item Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of
rebuttal or criticism
\end{enumerate}



\section{Ampliative Arguments}


Deductively valid arguments with plausible premises are good arguments, but they aren't the only good arguments there are. This is just as well, since many arguments we give in our everyday lives are not deductively valid, even after filling in plausible missing premises. Here's an example:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[] In January 1997, it rained in London.
		\item[] In January 1998, it rained in London.
		\item[] In January 1999, it rained in London.
		\item[] In January 2000, it rained in London.
	\item[\therefore] It rains every January in London.
\end{earg}

This argument generalises from observations about several cases to a conclusion about all cases---in each year listed, it rained in January, so it does in every year. Such arguments are called \define{inductive} arguments. The argument could be made stronger by adding additional premises before drawing the conclusion: In January 2001, it rained in London; In January 2002\ldots. But, however many premises of this form we add, the argument will remain invalid. Even if it has rained in London in every January thus far, it remains possible that London will stay dry next January. The point of all this is that inductive arguments—even good inductive arguments—are not (deductively) valid. They are not watertight. The premises might make the conclusion very likely, but they don't absolutely guarantee its truth. Unlikely though it might be, it is possible for their conclusion to be false, even when all of their premises are true.

Inductive arguments of the sort just given belong to a species of argument called \define{ampliative arguments}. This means that the conclusion goes beyond what you find in the premises. That is, the premises don't guarantee, or entail, the conclusion. They do, however, provide some support for it. These arguments are deductively invalid. They may be good and useful, however it is important to know the difference. 

In this book, we will set aside the question of what makes for a good ampliative argument and focus instead on sorting the deductively valid arguments from the deductively invalid ones. 
But we pause here to mention some further forms of ampliative argument.

Inductive arguments, like the one we saw above, \todo{At end of 2.1. I said we're not allowed this terminology!}infer from a series of observed cases to a generalization that covers them: from all observed $F$s have been $G$s, we infer all $F$s are $G$s. We use these all the time. Every time I've drunk water from my tap, it's quenched my thirst; therefore, every time I ever drink water from my tap, it will quench my thirst. Every time I've stroked my neighbour's cat, it hasn't bitten me; therefore, every time I ever stroke my neighbour's cat, it won't bite me. And it's a form of arguments much beloved by scientists. Every time we've measured the acceleration of a body falling, it's matched Newton's theory, therefore, all bodies are governed by Newton's theory. The premises of these argument seem to make their conclusions likely without guaranteeing them. The areas of philosophy called inductive logic or confirmation theory try to make precise what that means and why it's true. And of course inductive arguments can go wrong. Before I visited Australia, every swan I'd every seen was white, and so I concluded that all swans were white; but when I visited Australia, I realised my conclusion was wrong, because some swans there are black.

A closely related, but different form of argument, is \define{statistical}. Here, we start with an observation about the proportion of Fs that are Gs in a sample that we've observed, and we infer that the same proportion of Fs are Gs in general. So, for instance, if I poll 1,000 people in Scotland eligible to vote in a second independence referendum, and 600 say that they'll vote yes, I might infer that 60\% of all eligible voters will vote yes. Or if I test 1,000,000 people in England for an active infection, and 20,000 test positive, I might infer that 2\% of the whole population has an active infection. How good these argument are depends on a number of things, and these are studied by statisticians. For instance, suppose you picked the 1,000 Scottish voters entirely at random from an anonymised version of the electoral register. But suppose that, when you deanonymised, you learned that, by chance, all of the people you'd picked were over 65, or they all lived on the Isle of Skye. Then you might worry that your sample, though random, was unrepresentative of the population as a whole. This question is a genuine concern for randomised controlled trials in medicine.

Abductive arguments provide an inference from a phenomenon you've observed to the \emph{best explanation} of that phenomenon: from $E$, and the best explanation of $E$ is $H$, you might conclude $H$. Again, this is extremely widespread. A classic sort of example would be the inferences that detectives draw during their investigations. They look at the evidence and the possible explanations of it, and they tend to conclude in favour of the best one. And similarly for doctors looking at a patient's suite of symptoms and trying to discover what ails them. Another important example comes from science. Here is Charles Darwin explaining what convinces him of his theory of natural selection: 
\begin{quotation}
``It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the several large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used by the greatest natural philosophers."\\ (Charles Darwin, On the origin of species by means of natural selection (6th ed.).
London: John Murray)

\chapter{Other logical notions}\label{s:BasicNotions}

In \S\ref{s:Valid}, we introduced the idea of a valid argument. We will want to introduce some more ideas that are important in logic.

%\section{Truth values}
%As we said in \S\ref{s:Arguments}, arguments consist of premises and a conclusion. Note that many kinds of English sentence cannot be used to express premises or conclusions of arguments. For example:
%	\begin{ebullet}
%		\item \textbf{Questions}, e.g.\ `are you feeling sleepy?'
%		\item \textbf{Imperatives}, e.g.\ `Wake up!'
%		\item \textbf{Exclamations}, e.g.\ `Ouch!'
%	\end{ebullet}
%The common feature of these three kinds of sentence is that they are not \emph{assertoric}: they cannot be true or false. It does not even make sense to ask whether a \emph{question} is true (it only makes sense to ask whether the \emph{answer} to a question is true).

%The general point is that, the premises and conclusion of an argument must be capable of having a \define{truth value}. The two truth values that concern us are just True and False. 

\section{Joint possibility}

Consider these two sentences:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item[B1.] Jane's only brother is shorter than her.
		\item[B2.] Jane's only brother is taller than her.
	\end{ebullet}
Logic alone cannot tell us which, if either, of these sentences is true. Yet we can say that \emph{if} the first sentence (B1) is true, \emph{then} the second sentence (B2) must be false. Similarly, if B2 is true, then B1 must be false. It is impossible that both sentences are true together. These sentences are inconsistent with each other, they cannot all be true at the same time. This motivates the following definition:
	\factoidbox{
		Sentences are \define{jointly possible} if and only if it is possible for them all to be true together.
	}
Conversely, B1 and B2 are \emph{jointly impossible}.

\newglossaryentry{possibility}
{
name=joint possibility,
text={jointly possible},
description={A property possessed by some sentences when they can all be true at the same time}
}

We can ask about the possibility of any number of sentences. For example, consider the following four sentences:
	\begin{ebullet}	
		\item[G1.] \label{MartianGiraffes} There are at least four giraffes at the wild animal park.
		\item[G2.] There are exactly seven gorillas at the wild animal park.
		\item[G3.] There are not more than two martians at the wild animal park.
		\item[G4.] Every giraffe at the wild animal park is a martian.
	\end{ebullet}
G1 and G4 together entail that there are at least four martian giraffes at the park. This conflicts with G3, which implies that there are no more than two martian giraffes there. So the sentences G1--G4 are jointly impossible. They cannot all be true together. (Note that the sentences G1, G3 and G4 are jointly impossible. But if sentences are already jointly impossible, adding an extra sentence to the mix will not make them jointly possible!)

\section[Necessary truths, falsehoods, and contingency]{Necessary truths, necessary falsehoods, and contingency}

In assessing arguments for validity, we care about what would be true \emph{if} the premises were true, but some sentences just \emph{must} be true. Consider these sentences:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[\ex{Acontingent}] It is raining.
		\item[\ex{Atautology}] Either it is raining here, or it is not.
		\item[\ex{Acontradiction}] It is both raining here and not raining here.
	\end{earg}
In order to know if sentence \ref{Acontingent} is true, you would need to look outside or check the weather channel. It might be true; it might be false. A sentence which is capable of being true and capable of being false (in different circumstances, of course) is called \define{contingent}.

\newglossaryentry{contingent sentence}
{
name=contingent sentence,
description={A sentence that is neither a \gls{necessary truth} nor a \gls{necessary falsehood}; a sentence that in some situations is true and in others false}
}

Sentence \ref{Atautology} is different. You do not need to look outside to know that it is true. Regardless of what the weather is like, it is either raining or it is not. That is a \define{necessary truth}. 

\newglossaryentry{necessary truth}
{
name={necessary truth},
description={A sentence that must be true}
}

Equally, you do not need to check the weather to determine whether or not sentence \ref{Acontradiction} is true. It must be false, simply as a matter of logic. It might be raining here and not raining across town; it might be raining now but stop raining even as you finish this sentence; but it is impossible for it to be both raining and not raining in the same place and at the same time. So, whatever the world is like, it is not both raining here and not raining here. It is a \define{necessary falsehood}.

\newglossaryentry{necessary falsehood}
{
name={necessary falsehood},
description={A sentence that must be false}
}

%Something might \emph{always} be true and still be contingent. For instance, if there never were a time when the universe contained fewer than seven things, then the sentence `At least seven things exist' would always be true. Yet the sentence is contingent: the world could have been much, much smaller than it is, and then the sentence would have been false. 


\section{Necessary and sufficient conditions}\label{s.Nec Sufficient Conditions}
We can also ask about the logical relations \emph{between} two sentences. \todo{I didn't like sufficient and necessary because the ``conditions'' talk didn't really work. Should I just delete it??}

Consider the two sentences:
\begin{earg}
\item Fido is a bulldog.
\item Fido is a dog.
\end{earg}
Fido being a bulldog is \define{sufficient condition} for Fido being a dog.
%If we know that Fido is a bulldog, that's all the information we need to conclude that Fido is a dog. 
The argument 
\begin{earg}
\item Fido is a bulldog.
\item[\therefore] Fido is a dog.
\end{earg} is a valid argument. And 
\begin{earg}
\item[] If Fido is a bulldog, then Fido is a dog.
\end{earg}is necessarily true.

	\factoidbox{
		\metaX is \define{sufficient for} \metaY if it's impossible for \metaX to be true and \metaY false. 
	}

The other way around is a \define{necessary condition}. For Fido to be a bulldog it is \emph{necessary} that Fido is a dog. There's no way he could be a bulldog without being a dog. 

	\factoidbox{
		\metaX is \define{necessary for}  \metaY if it's impossible for \metaY to be true and \metaX false. 
	}




Sometimes a sentence is both necessary and sufficient for a second sentence. For example:
\begin{earg}
\item[] John went to the store after he washed the dishes.
\item[] John washed the dishes before he went to the store.
\end{earg}
The sentences must have the same truth value. 
%These two sentences are both contingent, since John might not have gone to the store or washed dishes at all. Yet they must have the same truth-value.
 If either of the sentences is true, then they both are; if either of the sentences is false, then they both are. We then say that they are \define{necessarily equivalent}.


\newglossaryentry{necessary equivalence}
{
name={necessary equivalence},
text={necessarily equivalent},
description={A property held by a pair of sentences that must always have the same truth value}
}



\section*{Summary of logical notions}

\begin{itemize}
\item An argument is (deductively) \define{valid} if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false; it is \define{invalid} otherwise.

\item A \define{necessary truth} is a sentence that must be true, that could not possibly be false.

\item A \define{necessary falsehood} is a sentence that must be false, that could not possibly be true.

\item A \define{contingent sentence} is neither a necessary truth nor a necessary falsehood. It may be true but could have been false, or vice versa.

\item A sentence is \define{suffient for} a second sentence if it's impossible for the first to be true and the second false. 

\item A sentence is \define{necessary for} a second sentence if it's impossible for the second to be true and the first false. 

\item Two sentences are \define{necessarily equivalent} if they must have the same truth value.

\item A collection of sentences is \define{jointly possible} if it is possible for all these sentences to be true together; it is \define{jointly impossible} otherwise.
\end{itemize}
